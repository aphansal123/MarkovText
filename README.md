# MarkovText
My implementation of a doubly-linked list and a Markov text generating algorithm that uses linked lists. If you run the MainApp.java file in my MOOCTextEditor repository using these files, you can enter any piece of text and generate random Markov sentences (using the same patterns in the input text).
